          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        <p class="white-70">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition 
          and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and 
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - 
          time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software 
          Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. 
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </h3>
        <p class="black-70">
          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals 
          who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who 
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They 
          were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was 
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve 
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land 
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
